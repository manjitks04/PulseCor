Movement doesn't have to mean hours at the gym. Small changes like taking the stairs, walking during lunch breaks, or stretching every hour add up to big health benefits.

Start small. Even 10 minutes of movement counts. Take a walk around the block, do some gentle stretches, or dance to your favorite song. The key is consistency, not intensity.

Find activities you enjoy. If you hate running, don't run. Try swimming, cycling, yoga, or dancing instead. When you enjoy the activity, you're more likely to stick with it.

Your body was made to move. Regular physical activity strengthens your heart, boosts your mood, improves sleep, and helps manage weight. Every step counts toward a healthier you.
