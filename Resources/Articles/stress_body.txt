Stress affects your body in real, physical ways. It can raise your blood pressure, disrupt your sleep, weaken your immune system, and even impact your digestion. Understanding this connection is the first step to managing it.

Your body doesn't distinguish between different types of stress. Whether it's work pressure, relationship conflicts, or financial worries, your body responds with the same stress hormones that were designed for immediate physical threats.

Chronic stress takes a toll. When your stress response is constantly activated, it can lead to serious health problems over time. That's why stress management isn't optional—it's essential for your physical health.

You have more control than you think. Through relaxation techniques, regular exercise, adequate sleep, and healthy boundaries, you can significantly reduce stress's impact on your body.
