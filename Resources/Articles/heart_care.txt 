Your heart health is influenced by diet, exercise, stress management, and sleep. A holistic approach means addressing all these factors together for optimal cardiovascular wellness.

Nutrition matters. Focus on whole foods, plenty of vegetables and fruits, lean proteins, and healthy fats like those found in fish, nuts, and olive oil. What you eat directly impacts your heart.

Movement is medicine. Regular physical activity strengthens your heart muscle, improves circulation, and helps control blood pressure and cholesterol. Aim for at least 30 minutes most days.

Manage stress naturally. Chronic stress takes a toll on your heart. Practice relaxation techniques, connect with loved ones, get enough sleep, and find healthy ways to cope with life's challenges. Your heart will thank you.
