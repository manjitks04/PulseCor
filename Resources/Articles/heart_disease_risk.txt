Heart disease is often preventable. Understanding your risk factors is the first step toward protecting your heart. Some factors you can't control, like age and family history, but many you can.

High blood pressure and cholesterol are major risk factors. These silent conditions damage your arteries over time without obvious symptoms. Regular check-ups help catch them early when they're easiest to manage.

Lifestyle factors matter enormously. Smoking, poor diet, lack of exercise, and excess weight all increase your risk. The good news? These are all within your control. Small changes in daily habits can significantly reduce your risk.

Don't ignore warning signs. Chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or unusual fatigue shouldn't be dismissed. Early detection and treatment can prevent heart attacks and save lives. Talk to your doctor about your personal risk factors and create a prevention plan together.
