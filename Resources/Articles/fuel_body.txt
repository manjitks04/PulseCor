What you eat directly impacts how you feel. Focus on whole foods, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables to maintain steady energy levels throughout the day.

Think of food as fuel. Your body runs best on nutrient-dense whole foods. Processed foods might give you a quick energy spike, but they'll leave you crashing later.

Balance is key. Include protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates in each meal. This combination keeps your blood sugar stable and your energy consistent throughout the day.

Hydration matters too. Sometimes fatigue is simply dehydration in disguise. Drink water consistently throughout the day, not just when you're thirsty. Your body—and your energy levels—will thank you.
