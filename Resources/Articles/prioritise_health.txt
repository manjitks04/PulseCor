Self-care isn't selfish. Taking time for your physical and mental health allows you to show up better for everything else in life. Start with small, consistent habits.

You can't pour from an empty cup. When you neglect your own wellbeing, you have less energy and patience for work, relationships, and responsibilities. Prioritizing your health benefits everyone around you.

Small steps lead to big changes. You don't need to overhaul your entire life overnight. Start with one healthy habit—drinking more water, taking a daily walk, or going to bed 30 minutes earlier.

Make appointments with yourself. Schedule time for exercise, meal prep, or relaxation just like you would any other important commitment. Protect that time. You're worth it.
