Water is essential for every function in your body. It regulates temperature, cushions joints, delivers nutrients to cells, and helps flush out toxins. Staying hydrated isn't just about quenching thirst.

How much do you really need? The "8 glasses a day" rule is a good starting point, but your actual needs depend on your activity level, climate, and overall health. A better guide: drink enough that your urine is pale yellow.

Timing matters too. Don't wait until you're thirsty—that's a sign you're already mildly dehydrated. Sip water consistently throughout the day rather than chugging large amounts all at once.

Beyond plain water. Foods like fruits and vegetables also contribute to hydration. However, be mindful that caffeine and alcohol can have a mild dehydrating effect, so balance them with extra water.
